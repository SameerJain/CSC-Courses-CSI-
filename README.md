# Computer Science and Engineering Courses

This repository contains materials for three Computer Science and Engineering courses: CSE126, CSE221, and CSE326. These courses cover a range of topics from introductory programming to data structures.

## CSE126: Introduction to Computer Science

**Course Description:**
Computing and information processing. Basic computer structure. Programming methodology: analysis, design, documentation, implementation, and evaluation. Algorithmic approach to problem solving. Computer solutions of several numerical and non-numerical problems.

**Reference Book:**
C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design by Malik. 6th/7th/8th edition.

## CSE221: Intermediate Programming in C++

This course builds upon the foundations laid in CSE126, diving deeper into C++ programming concepts.

**Final Exam Review Topics:**
1. Sorting Algorithms:
   - Selection Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Insertion Sort
2. Searching Algorithms:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
3. Function Templates
4. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming:
   - Class definitions
   - Constructors and Destructors
   - Operator Overloading
5. Recursive Functions
6. Enums
7. Structs

## CSE326: Data Structures

This course focuses on fundamental data structures and their implementations.

**Course Topics:**
- Review of C++ programming constructs: arrays, pointers, structs
- Data Structures and Objects
- Recursion
- Simple List ADT
- Stacks
- Queues
- Running time analysis
- Trees
- Sorting

## Repository Structure

Each course has its own directory:

```
