# Computer Science and Engineering Courses

This repository contains materials for three Computer Science and Engineering courses: CSE126, CSE221, and CSE326. These courses cover topics ranging from introductory programming to data structures.

## CSE126: Introduction to Computer Science

**Course Description:**
Computing and information processing. Basic computer structure. Programming methodology: analysis, design, documentation, implementation, and evaluation. An algorithmic approach to problem-solving. Computer solutions of several numerical and non-numerical problems.

**Reference Book:**
C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design by Malik. 6th/7th/8th edition.

## CSE221: Intermediate Programming in C++

This course builds upon the foundations laid in CSE126, diving deeper into C++ programming concepts.

**Final Exam Review Topics:**
1. Sorting Algorithms:
   - Selection Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Insertion Sort
2. Searching Algorithms:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
3. Function Templates
4. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming:
   - Class definitions
   - Constructors and Destructors
   - Operator Overloading
5. Recursive Functions
6. Enums
7. Structs

## CSE326: Data Structures

This course focuses on fundamental data structures and their implementations.

**Course Topics:**
- Review of C++ programming constructs: arrays, pointers, structs
- Data Structures and Objects
- Recursion
- Simple List ADT
- Stacks
- Queues
- Running time analysis
- Trees
- Sorting

## Repository Structure

Each course has its own directory:

```
/
├── CSE126/
├── CSE221/
└── CSE326/
```

You'll find relevant course materials, assignments, and projects within each directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific course directory you're interested in.
3. Review the README file in each course directory for specific instructions on setup and use of materials.
